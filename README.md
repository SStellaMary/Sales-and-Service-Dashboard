Here is a summary of the key data insights and a data storytelling approach using IBM Cognos analytics:

**Overview:**
- This Cognos dashboard provides sales, service, and social media analytics for an automotive company.

**Key Insights: **
-The Champlain model seems to be a focus point, with high sales but also the highest number of recalls, primarily due to issues with seats and restraints.
-Despite the high number of recalls, customer sentiment remains largely neutral to positive, suggesting effective handling of service issues.
-There's significant variation in dealer performance, with some dealers significantly outperforming others in terms of profit.
-Sales and profit show seasonal trends, with end-of-year (December) being particularly strong.
-While the company is profitable, the high number of recalls, particularly for one model and system, indicates potential quality control issues that need addressing.

**Data Storytelling Framework:  **

This Power BI dashboard presents a comprehensive view of sales and service data for what appears to be an automotive company. Let's break down the data story in detail:

1. Sales Overview:
   - Total Quantity Sold: 58,118 units
   - The dashboard shows a "Profit" gauge, but the exact figure isn't visible. However, it seems to be approaching or at 1 million (based on the "= 1M Profit" label).

2. Quantity Sold by Model:
   - The top-selling model has approximately 19,373 units sold.
   - There are at least 5 different models shown, with varying sales quantities.

3. Profit by Dealer ID:
   - The chart shows profit distribution across different dealer IDs (1212, 1215, 1217, etc.).
   - Dealer 1336 stands out with the highest profit, reaching nearly 10 million.
   - There's significant variation in profit across dealers, suggesting different performance levels or market conditions.

4. Service Data:
   a) Recalls by Model:
      - Five models are shown: Beaufort, Champlain, Hudson, Labrador, and Salish.
      - Champlain has the highest number of recalls, around 40,000.
      - Other models have significantly fewer recalls.

   b) Customer Sentiment:
      - Positive: 14,528
      - Neutral: 44,885
      - Negative: Not specified, but presumably the remainder
      - This suggests that while there are more neutral responses, positive sentiment outweighs negative.

   c) Profit and Quantity Sold by Month:
      - The graph shows monthly trends for both quantity sold and profit.
      - There are significant fluctuations month to month.
      - December seems to have the highest quantity sold and profit.
      - Some months show a mismatch between quantity sold and profit, indicating potential variations in pricing or product mix.

   d) Affected Systems in Recalls:
      - Various systems are listed: Airbag, Engine, Fuel Supply, Powertrain, Seats and Restraints, Steering, Suspension, Tires, Visual Systems, and Others.
      - Seats and Restraints have the highest number of recalls at 60,940.
      - The second highest is not clearly visible but appears to be around 4,048 recalls.

5. Applied Filters:
   - Some visualizations have specific filters applied:
     - Affected System: Seats and Restraints
     - Model: Champlain
     - Sentiment: All types (Positive, Neutral, Negative) included
This dashboard provides a holistic view of the company's performance, balancing sales success with service challenges, and highlighting areas for potential improvement in product quality and dealer performance.
